# Gradient analysis for SPINS
Tigrlab project

Derived SPINS study data can be found at https://github.com/edickie/ssd_gradients , or locally on KIMEL server at /scratch/edickie/ssd_gradients

Requirements for the virtual environment for Jupyter can be found at nilearn_brainspace_requirements.txt

Software used for this project includes Jupyter notebook and RStudio. Brainspace packages were installed to the python environment to facilitate gradient creation.

- template gradients used for alignment (HCP and margulies):
- HCP gradients found at `/group-HCPS1200_atlas-GlasserTian_desc-subcorticalS2_conn.pconn.nii`
- margulies gradients found at `/tpl-fsLR_den-32k_atlas-Glasser2016Tian2019S2_desc-margulies2016_gradients.pscalar.nii`

Reproducible code and functions can be found in `/code`.
